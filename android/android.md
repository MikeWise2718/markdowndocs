# Intro
If there is one thing I forget faster than how to configure Android, I don't know what it is. And a lot of it is Android manufacturer specific.
 - I used an LG Nexus 5X for a couple of years
 - Now I have a Huaewi Mate 9

# Concepts
 * Lock screen - Duh..
 * Home screen - a configurable number of screens that appear after you unlock
 * App pages?

# Android SDK
 * Installed using Visual Studio
 * Accessed in VS Menu under `Tools/Android/Android SDK Manager`
 * Installation directory in bar on top - this time it was `C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk`

# Xamarin notes
  * Have to install all the Xamerin tools with Visual Studio Installer
  * If you have the device plugged in and have enabled USB debugging on the Android, and `adb devices` lists the device (see below),then it should appear in the Visusl Studio Debug dropdown<br>
   ![VS Menu](vsmenu.png) as a build option
  * You can build an APK by right clicking on the project in the Solution Explorer with the `archive` command
  * You will get app not installed unless you sign it - instructions here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/deploy-test/signing/?tabs=windows>
  * 

# File Manager
 * There is an android file manager normally
 * Downloaded files go into download

# Using adb to examine the Android system log (logcat)
* In the Android SDK you can use `adb` - but it needs to be in path (`c:\program files\android\platform-toos\`)
* If you connect the android device and enable USB debugging it should be recognized by `adb` without further commands
* You can use then `adb logcat` to see all the "Android System Messages" being logged - you can filter them with grep - see below
* I think that Unity `debug.log` sends commands to the Android System Messages log
* Using logcat - <https://logmatic.io/blog/a-how-to-guide-to-debugging-with-android-logcat/>
* You can also debug without the USB with various commands: 
* Examples:
  * Look at error level adb commands `adb logcat "*:E"`
  * Connect via IP: `adb connect 192.168.1.179`
  * Start a server on an attached device (?) `adb tcpip 5555`

# Unity remote touch debugging
* Download "Unity Remote 5" app from Google Playstore <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.genericremote&hl=en>
* Enable USB Debugging on android device in Settings/Developer
* Start the above remote app on the Android device
* Connect device with USB (might want to check if `adb` can see it - see above)
* Start it running on the remote app
* In Unity project Enable it with `Edit/Project Settings` then under Editor there is a`"Unity Remote` section
* Make sure the Device is `Any Android Device` - top line <br>

# APKs
 * Android Package files are applications
 * Seemingly they need to be signed

# Home Screen
 - Launcher - Settings / Apps & Notifications / Deafult Apps / Lanucher
 - Number of home screens - 
    - Go to a blank area of a home screen
    - Hold your finger there until a configuation screen opens (Huwai home?).
    - Settings / Home Layout 
    -  Select the size you want (5x5, 4x5, 3x5)
