# Intro
If there is one thing I forget faster than how to configure Android, I don't know what it is. And a lot of it is Android manufacturer specific.
 - I used an LG Nexus 5X for a couple of years
 - Now I have a Huaewi Mate 9

# Concepts
 * Lock screen - Duh..
 * Home screen - a configurable number of screens that appear after you unlock
 * App pages?


# Home Screen
 - Launcher - Settings / Apps & Notifications / Deafult Apps / Lanucher
 - Number of home screens - 
    - Go to a blank area of a home screen
    - Hold your finger there until a configuation screen opens (Huwai home?).
    - Settings / Home Layout 
    -  Select the size you want (5x5, 4x5, 3x5)
