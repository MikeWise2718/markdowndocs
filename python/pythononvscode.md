## VS Code
VS Code is a general editor, made for working with lots of different kinds of projects - but kept lightweight. Portability to platforms like MacOS and Linux are also high priorities.


VS Code is "folder based", that means it loads settings from a folder that you "open". Here you can specify if it is to operate in different kinds of modes. This document will mostly be around how to operate it in python model

VS Code changes frequently. You practially have to up date it every week. ALso the ways you work with it have changed over time.

What to do:
- Install VS Code
- Install a  good Python Language Extnestion, the one from Don Jayamanne is the most common
- You might need to close VS Code now if you need a python envionment

To activate a particular python environment
- Go to the top level menu and enter /View/Command Palette..
- From the Text Box that now opens, select Python: Select Python Interpreter
- You should get a list of available Python versions with their environments listed underneath them
