# Windows 11 preveiw edition keeps deleting python and its environment
- configuring Auditing from (https://discuss.python.org/t/python-deleting-itself/22830/3)
```
First, run the management console snap-in “secpol.msc”. Make the following change to enable access auditing:

-Expand “Security Settings” → “Local Policies”.
-Click “Audit Policy”.
-Double click “Audit object access”.
-Under “Audit these attempts”, enable “Success”.
-Close the security policy snap-in.

Then in Explorer, for each folder:

-Right-click the folder and select “Properties”.
-Select the “Security” tab and click the “Advanced” button.
-Select the “Auditing” tab
-If asked, click “Continue” to allow administrator access, and “Yes” if prompted for consent.
-Click “Add”.
-Click “Select a principal”.
-Enter “Everyone”, and click “OK”.
-In the “Type” drop-down box, select “Success”.
-In the “Applies to” drop-down box, select how the rule should be inherited:
-If the directory itself is always deleted, select “This folder only”.
-If sometimes just a subdirectory or file is deleted, select “This folder, subfolders, and files”.
-Click “Clear all” to uncheck the basic permissions.
-Click “Show advanced permissions”.
-Enable “Delete”. It should be the only enabled permission.
-Click OK to close the auditing entry dialog.
-Click OK to close the advanced security settings dialog.
-Click OK to close the properties dialog.

After one of the monitored directories or files gets mysteriously deleted or moved, open the management console’s event-viewer snap-in “eventvwr.msc”. Expand “Windows Logs”, and click “Security”. Click on the first event in the list, and press Ctrl+F to open the search box. Search for the name of the directory or file. If an event is found, double click on it to show the event properties. Among other things, the auditing event will show the user account, process ID, and process name that successfully opened the file or directory with delete access.

Once you no longer need access auditing, disable it in the security-policy snap-in, and remove the auditing rules from the directories.
