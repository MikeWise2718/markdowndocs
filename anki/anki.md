# Intro
- Anki is "the" flash card program
- Docs are a bit spotty but can be found here: (https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html)
- There is a desktop version, a web version, and a few client versions
- You need to be logged in to use it properly, and you back up your decks in the cloud. For some reason this is free.
- There are a number of shared uploaded decks you can download for study here: (https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/)
    - You download them and load them into your Anki 


# Object Model
- Decks ... kind of confusing, they can be heirarchical if you name them that way
- Notes
- Fields
