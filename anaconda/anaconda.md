# Intro
Anaconda - probably the main Python package for scientific computing.

# Starting it
- To start anaconda start the prompt "Anaconda prompt" from the windows Icon
- You can see where it installed with the where command:
 - I had it in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\VS15Preview\Anaconda3_64\python.exe"


# Installation
- WHen you install it you can choose a directory.
- My default when installing on windows was "C:\Users\mike\Anaconda3"
- Seems that in the past it might have put it in "C:\Users\mike\AppData"
