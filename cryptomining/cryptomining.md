# Intro

# Background

# Sites

- MSI Afterburner: (https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner)

- Nicehash: (https://www.nicehash.com/my/dashboard)
- NiceHash on Linux - 



# NiceHash on Linux
- nuxhash - https://github.com/YoRyan/nuxhash
- `nuxhashd &`
- There is also the option of starting a process with a trailing ampersand `&` which detaches it from your process so it will keep running
-  but not sure what happens when it tries io to the missing terminal process - maybe it crashes?


# Another way
- Start a detachable session (persistent screen) `screen` then return after the startup text
   - you can check it with `screen -r` now
    - `nuxhashd`
