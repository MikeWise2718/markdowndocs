# Intro
Because PhotoShop is too expensive (in the long run), and Gimp is too hard for casual use, I have opted for "Paint.net".

It is quite powerful becuse of the huge amount of plug-ins that are available.

It costs like 8 dollars if you buy it in the Windows Store, but you can also download it for free (what is with that?)

# Installation
* The windows store installation apparently has some issues and you have to create some folders


# Plugins
* Plugins are "installed" simply by dropping them into the `C:/Users/username/Documents/paint.net APP Files/Effects` folder
* 3D Text - "TR's Monolithic" is pretty good. <https://forums.getpaint.net/topic/108312-trs-monolithic-3d-text-generator-dec-3rd-2018/>
* Making things transparent - use the "Color to Alpha" plug-in from Tanel <https://forums.getpaint.net/topic/7767-color-to-alpha-v22-2008-12-24/>
