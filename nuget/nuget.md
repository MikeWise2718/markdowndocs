- Key will expire one year from 7 Feb 2019 (when I created it)
- Command to push library to nuget.org: 
    - increment the version number in `common.csproj`
    - `dotnet build` as usual
    - then change to directory with nuget package (`.\bin\Debug\`) 
    - then enter `dotnet nuget push .\VafspLib.1.0.0.nupkg -k oy2dmxphhoxdtce2bxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxqou5ihhmljqfnj23m -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`
    - then wait for it to publish, which can take up to an hour
