## MRTK - Mixed Reality Toolkit Version v1.2017.1.2 - 6 Oct 2017 Build

* Installed it on 27 October
* Github is here https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity 
* It is probably version from 6 Oct as most assets have that date
* Package Name: "HoloToolkit-Unity-v1.2017.1.2.unitypackage"
* Top Menu Item is now "Mixed Reality Toolkit" instead of "HoloLens Toolkit"
* Insted of "Apply HoloLens Project Settings" is now "Apply Mixed Reality Project Settings"
* Forgot to mention that have to setup camer:
  * set transform position to 0,0,0 
  * Set *Clear Flags* property to "Solid color"
  * Set color to 0,0,0,0
* Did not mention fields to set application name (wtf are they?)
* Did not mention need to set checkboxes for *SpatialPerception* and *Microphone* in Player Settings under Publishing Settings/Capabilities
* The Spatial Mapper changed pretty drastically, totally new components, and no on/off switch (which didn't seem work anyway).
* I think it only works with Visual Studio 2017
* There are MRTP - Mixed Reality Technical Previews that you need to have given to you
