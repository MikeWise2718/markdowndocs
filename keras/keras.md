# Intro
Keras - a simple intuitive Python layer on top of several Neual Network frameworks - like TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK, and probably a few more.

Pretty good MNIST Tutorial can be found [here](https://elitedatascience.com/keras-tutorial-deep-learning-in-python#step-1)
A capsule implementation in Keras is explained and presented [here]https://jhui.github.io/2017/11/03/Dynamic-Routing-Between-Capsules/() 
The code for the above is [here](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Fashion-MNIST)
The Boltzman implementation for MNIST is [here]()
