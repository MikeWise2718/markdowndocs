# Ryzen
- AM5 currently only makes sense up to 64 GB
- Excerp from (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/z0d178/would_256gb_of_ram_be_possible_on_am5/)
```
Ryzen 7000 series does not make sense even with 128 GB, because the memory controller AMD has put into those CPUs is made to be intentionally bad: 128 GB will only run at 3.6 GHz data transfer speed, not 5.2 GHz as 64 GB, which is a major slowdown for a system that is supposed to be speedy (like 7950/X3D).
```
