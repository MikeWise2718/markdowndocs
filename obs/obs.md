# Intro
- OBS means Open Broadcast Software (https://obsproject.com)
- Great intro video - (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTkpLd3tdbc) 
- Apparently you should start it in Administrator mode

# Concepts
- Source (a video, audio source, image, etc)
- Scene (a collectoin of sources (kind of as layers))
- Scene Collections (a collection of sence)
- Settings (a hellishly large collection of settings)
- Provile (Collection of settigns)


# Starting it
- It is damn hard sometimes to figure out how to get it to start recording

# Windows
- To operate it you need all four panels, Scenes, Sources, Audio Mixer, and Controls
- They can be detached, put over each other as tabs, and moved around, so if you can't find one it could be anywhere
- You free a tab by clicking on the top right corner of thw window (the double window icon)



# Scenes and sources
- A scene is a group of sources
