# Intro
- An awesome little computer that can hook up to the world wirelessly and report things like temperatures.
- Thank you Jonathan for telling me about it :)
- I have two "Sonoff TH10 Wifi Smart Switches" got it for like 8 Euros- review here: (https://tech.scargill.net/sonoff-th10-and-th16/)

- How to replace the firmware: (https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota)


# Based on the ESP8266
- explanation: (https://hackaday.com/2015/03/18/how-to-directly-program-an-inexpensive-esp8266-wifi-module/)

# Initializig
- Ewelink didn't work so tried "EPS2866 Smart Config" instead on Jonathans recommendation
- That did't work either, so went back to Ewelink, and this time it worked.
