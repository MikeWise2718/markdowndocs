# Intro
Functional programming came to C# with linq around 2007
- Called "Language Integrated Query" - not the greatest name as it makes it seem like SQL
- History and General notes: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query>
- Getting Started <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/getting-started-with-linq>
- Two different "syntax's" Query Syntax and Method Syntax (you want to use the second) <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/query-syntax-and-method-syntax-in-linq>
