# Intro
No need to explain what this is.

Wish I had done this years ago as I have forgotten most of what I knew about Visual Studio.

#Startup
- Startup Modes [here](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/blog/s153/visual-studio-startup.htm)
- Couldn't find how to set these in VS 2017

# VS Command Prompt
- Windows key developer
- to set 64 bit you have to call vsvars64
- you can see which one is set with "which cl.exe" (if you installed git correctly)

# Packages
- Based on NuGet - explained by Scott Hanselman [here](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingNuGetPackageManagementForNETAnotherPieceOfTheWebStack.aspx)
- Microsoft docs [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget)

# Error logs
- Visual Studio has a few logs
- Instructions for enabling them can be found [here](http://blog.masterdevs.com/debugging-a-visual-studio-crash/)
- Activity log seems to always be written here: "C:/Users/mike/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/VisualStudio/15.0_93f079a7/ActivityLog.xml"
