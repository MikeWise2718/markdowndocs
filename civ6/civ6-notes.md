## FireTuner

* FireTuner - a program that allows you to modify all the values in the program. It also has a Lua console.
  * Installing FireTuner - Go to Steam, Install "Sid Meier's Civilation VI Development Tools"
  * Starting FireTuner 
    *  Go to Steam UI
    *  Start "Sid Meier's Civilization VI Development Tools"
    *   In the Menu that opens, click on "FireTuner"
    *   Once it opens, open a panel defition by
       * Navigating to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Debug
       * Choose a panel defintion file like "WorldBuilder.ltp"
  
  * Connecting to Civ VI
     * Go to Steam UI
     * Start "Sid Meier's Civilization VI"
     * Make sure you  enabled "Tuner" in the Main Menu under "Game Options" 
     * The game data should now appear in FireTuner

   * Fixing FireTuner panel definitions.
      * If you "broke" some files (like the defauult fireTuner panel definition files), you might be able  repair things by having Steam verify and then repair any damaged files
      * Note that the files actually belong to Civ VI (not the tools), so you have to verify those files, not the dev tools files
      * Also note that the files will not actually be restored until the next time you start Civ VI

   * Understanding FireTuner
      * There appears to be no real official documentation, although there probably is internally.
      * This post is extremely helpful [post](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/firaxis-live-tuner-helpful-observations.619108/#post-14795122)
