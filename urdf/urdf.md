# URDF

- Matlab has a good explanation (https://www.mathworks.com/help/sm/ug/urdf-model-import.html)


- A good article on creating a USD from a URDF
  - (https://medium.com/@jmake/a-practical-approach-to-the-nvidia-omniverse-robotics-simulation-toolkit-part-1-c7f068791954)
  - The repo:

# Coordinate System
- This document (about SDF) goes into how URDF defines them (http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=pose_frame_semantics&ver=1.5)
