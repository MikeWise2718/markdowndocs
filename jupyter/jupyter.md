# Intro
I think of Jupyter as R-Markdown for Python, but that is not really true.


# Configuration
 * There is no configuration by default. 
 * The command "jupyter notebook --generate-config" generates a commented out config file in the "~/.jupyter" directory
 * You can disable auth by commenting out a couple of lines
 * You can also set the default notebook directory, otherwise the default is the directory you start "jupyter notebook" from
 * you are supposed to activate the conda environment before you start jupyter, but there is also a tab you can select it from
