# Intro
- An AI company that we picked up in like June 2018. Big on using RL. (https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/20/microsoft-to-acquire-bonsai-in-move-to-build-brains-for-autonomous-systems/)
- Big on using RL.

# Inkling
- Have a language called Inkling which is purely functional (a bit snobbish about that), and focuses on definine concepts and how to use them with RL.
- Does not seem to do generative things?
- An "Architect" component chooses the models being used to learn something. (https://docs.bons.ai/guides/ai-engine-guide.html#architect)
- Currently has a fairly limited repertoire (Tensorflow, APEX, PPO) but this may be obsolete information - (https://docs.bons.ai/guides/ai-engine-guide.html#currently-supported-models)
- ApeX (https://xlnwel.github.io/blog/reinforcement%20learning/ApeX-IMPALA/)
