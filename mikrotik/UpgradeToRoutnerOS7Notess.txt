# MikroTik CRS Switch Upgrade to RouterOS7 Notes
Some notes about how I upgraded

## Original
- Doing this retroactively - 2017 was 8 or 9 years ago
- Default signin is Admin/(blank) 
- Changed it to be the same as my main router password 
- Assigned a static IP 192.168.25.3 - seemingly the gateway is 192.168.25.2 (which is wrong)
- Can be configured over Winbox (custom for MikroTik - works with only a mac address), or webfig (web configuration)
- RouterOS was 6.39.1
- See "Before Upgrade" screenshots for more

## Upgradced 16 Nov 2025
- Upgraded to RouterOS 7.20.4
- Automatic upgrade didn't work due to DNS failure
- Downloaded ntk and uploaded to router and rebooted
- Switch failed to route and failed to respond to http (webfig)
- Used Perplexity for debugging to delve into the Interwebs
- Key was using WinBox because you can log into it with just knowing the mac address 
- Mac address changed wetn I upgraded by the way, but just the last byte.
- Ultimate reason was the switch IP  was assigned to Port1 (the master port) only, and I was wired to Port10. WHen I changed it in the interface list it worked
- Not sure routing works still
- See "After Upgrade" screenshots for more
