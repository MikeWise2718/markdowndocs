# Original
- Doing this retroactively - 2017 was 8 or 9 years ago
- Default signin is Admin/(blank) 
- Changed it to be the same as my main router password 
- Assigned a static IP 192.168.25.3 - seemingly the gateway is 192.168.25.2 (which is wrong)
- Can be configured over Winbox (works with only a mac address), or webfig (web configuration)
- RouterOS was 6.39.1
- See screenshots for more

# Upgradced to RouterOS 7 16 Nov 2025
- Upgraded to RouterOS 7.20.4
- Automatic upgrade didn't work due to DNS failure (probably too old)
- Downloaded ntk and uploaded to router and rebooted
- Switch failed to route and failed to respond to http (webfig)
- ultimate reason was the swith IP was assigned to Port1 (the master port) only, and I was wired to Port10. WHen I changed it in the interface list it worked
- Not sure routing works still (seems to be not working as I couldn't just plug my windows box into it)

# Lessons learned
- Log into switch beforehand and screenshot everything
- Locate docs for initializing router from scratch including default user and password
