# KSP needs no explanatin
- Beginingers guide <https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Walkthrough_for_Ye_Compleat_Beginner>

# Command you simply must know
- Space bar - stages (sperates and throws away) rocket-stages, and it also ignites liquid fueled rockets (throttle it up first, see below). I think solid boosters always immediately ignite (?)
- Left shift - Increase the throttle on a liquid fuel rocket
- Left Ctrl - Decreses the throttle
- "Z" - Maximum thrust
- "Z" - Maximum thrust
- "a" and "d" - Pitch (on ground "a" is west - or 270 degrees, and "d" is east or 90 degrees)
- "w" and "s" - Yaw
- "T" - brings up your oSAS (Stability Assist System) - makes it unnessary to keep correcting your yaw and pitch commands - also has auto positioning for various rocket orientations
- "+" and "-" - zooms view

# In general
- Lauch with space bar
- Start tipping the rocket with "d" at 1000 m
- Be at 45 degrees at 10000 m
- Be at 90 degrees at 30000 m (fuel should be 2/3ds gone)

# Kerbol System
- Kerbol is Kerbin's sun - described here: <https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbol_System>
- Kerbin vs. Earth: <https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/20602-gravity-of-kerbin/>
