# Intro
Azure is huge, so we can't handle much of it here, but there are some things I need again and again that I forget.

One used to do things with PowerShell, but the Azure CLI 2.0 is a much better way, it is a python shell on top of PowerShell. See my page on the Azure CLI for more info here.

# Services
 - What services are avalable in which region is [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/)
 - In general these days (early 2018) West Europe has more things on offer than North Europe
 - South Central used to be my go-to region for new stuff, but I don't think that is true anymore.
 - capacity problems abound...

 # Azure IoT Hub
  - I moved this stuff to a dedicated page on it
