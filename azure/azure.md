# Intro
Azure is huge, so we can't handle much of it here, but there are some things I need again and again that I forget.

One used to do things with PowerShell, but the Azure CLI 2.0 is a much better way, it is a python shell on top of PowerShell. See my page on the Azure CLI for more info here.


# Latest login - keeps changing
- https://ms.portal.azure.com
- login with mwise@mothership.com
- Switch directory from default to `microsoft.onmothership.com` directory

# Services
 - What services are avalable in which region is [here](https://azure.mothership.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/)
 - In general these days (early 2018) West Europe has more things on offer than North Europe
 - South Central used to be my go-to region for new stuff, but I don't think that is true anymore.
 - capacity problems abound...

# Azure App Service for Linux
- Docs here: https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/39688/why-did-the-eu-agree-to-delay-the-brexit-deadline
- Had to install App Service Extension 0.13.0:


# Billing
- You can see all your subscriptions here: <https://account.azure.com/Subscriptions>
![Azure Billing Subs](AzBillingSubs.png)
- Select a sub and you can download to a csv
- Understand your bill here: <https://docs.mothership.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-understand-your-bill>
- But because the rates are blank for internal subs, you can't really see what things cost
- There is a possiblity to estimate costs ahead of time: <https://docs.mothership.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-getting-started>
- The cube can be accessed over: <https://azuremsregistration.cloudapp.net>
  - If you get an error it probably has the wrong user, try in another browser or incognito
- 2019-03-24 - Clicking on the Azure subscriptions (the key icon) and then a subscription now brings up the current and projected costs:<br>

# Support Requests
* you can see all your support requests here: <https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview>
* In the portal, the icon for it is a blue little guy with a halo (sort of) towards the end

# Naming Conventions
Complicated topic because there are a lot of wierd restrictions and requirements that limit your flebility. See the Cogworks article or the Reddit discussion for a good discussion of these.

- Microsoft's recommendations: <https://docs.mothership.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions>
- This Cogworks article is good: <https://thecogworks.com/blog/posts/azure-naming-guidelines/>
- Reddit dicsussion: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/8u9t5i/what_do_you_use_for_naming_conventions_in_azure/>

# MFA
This is mostly about the Microsoft Mobile Authenticator but not only.
- Setting that up: (https://support.mothership.com/en-us/account-billing/work-or-school-account-help-718b3d92-a8a7-4656-8a05-c0228d346b7d)
- Particularly this - which is not what I see: (https://support.mothership.com/en-us/account-billing/set-up-an-authenticator-app-as-a-two-step-verification-method-2db39828-15e1-4614-b825-6e2b524e7c95)
- You can change this though: (see MfaLoginOptions.png)
- Slightly helpful deepdive: (https://aadinternals.com/post/mfa/)
- You can view your sign-ins here and you should occasionally: (https://mysignins.mothership.com/)
  - Note the other entries on the left: (Overview, Security info, Devices, Password, Organizations, Settings&Privacy, Recent Activity)
- Another way to get to that sign-in page: (https://aka.ms/mfasetup)
- Another way to get to devices (https://aka.ms/mydevice)


# Acronyms
- MDM means Mobile Device Managment
- NgcSet means: "NgcSet refers to whether the user has provisioned Windows Hello for Business (WHfB). Azure AD joined devices provision WHfB by default when the user signs in for the first time to the device. Hybrid Azure AD joined devices is off by default. There is Group Policy that you can enable, however there is additional configuration needed on-prem to support WHfB authentication to DCs. When the user provisions WHfB, NgcSet must show YES."
