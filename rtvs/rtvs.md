# RTVS - R Tools for Visual Studio

[RTVS](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/rtvs/)

# Shiny
* Two ways to start a Shiny app 
  * Recommeded way is to have the Shiny App in the directory and using the icon in the toolbar
    * But if you start it that way you can't debug into a sourced module
  * You can also start it just using the source button
    * Then you can debug into a sourced module. Very odd...

# Debugging 
* Can't debug into a package
